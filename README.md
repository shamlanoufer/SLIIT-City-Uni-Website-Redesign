## 🌟 Key Features

This project demonstrates a complete HCI workflow with the following highlights:

### **Comprehensive Usability Study**
- Contextual inquiry with real IT undergraduate students  
- 24 usability issues identified across 4 main pages  
- Severity ratings and prioritized solutions  

### **Multi-Stage Design Process**
- Usability evaluation & problem identification  
- Low-fidelity paper prototypes  
- High-fidelity interactive prototypes with full functionality  

### **Advanced Prototyping Features**
