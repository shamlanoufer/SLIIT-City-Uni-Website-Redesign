## 🌟 Key Features

This project demonstrates a complete HCI workflow with the following highlights:

* **Comprehensive Usability Study**

  * Contextual inquiry with real IT undergraduate students
  * 24 usability issues identified across 4 main pages
  * Severity ratings and prioritized solutions

* **Multi-Stage Design Process**

  * Usability evaluation & problem identification
  * Low-fidelity paper prototypes
  * High-fidelity interactive prototype with full functionality

* **Advanced Prototyping Features**

  * Fully interactive navigation and dynamic elements
  * Responsive design optimized for all screen sizes
  * Hover effects, dropdown menus, and sticky AI assistant
  * Clear visual feedback for all user actions

* **Four Redesigned Pages**

  1. Home Page – Improved layout and information hierarchy
  2. Program Page (School of Computing) – Card-based program listings with filters
  3. Individual Program Page – Tabbed navigation for BSc (Hons) Cyber Security
  4. Pathways Page – Interactive academic pathway visualizations


## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

* **Design & Prototyping:** Figma, paper prototypes, design systems
* **Research & Documentation:** Contextual inquiry, persona development, usability heuristics, WCAG accessibility standards
* **Collaboration & Presentation:** Microsoft Office, video recording, OneDrive/SharePoint


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
